# Stormbot

## A simple CLI application that checks weather via OpenWeatherMap

### You will need to create an account at https://openweathermap.org and get an API key to use correctly. It would be improper to publish an API key here, I hope you understand my reasoning :)

## Node packages used:
### Node Fetch - used to be able to make async fetch calls to the API
### Prompt-Sync - used to gain user input

### At time of publishing (12/26/20) there are no vulnerabilities with the packages listed above, nor with any of their dependencies.

### Please enjoy, and clear skies to you!
